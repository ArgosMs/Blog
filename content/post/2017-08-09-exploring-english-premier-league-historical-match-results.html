<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In honor of the start of a new season for the English Premier League (EPL), I am putting together this exploratory data analysis of historical EPL data to see how teams typically do to start a season.</p>
</div>
<div id="general-data-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>General Data Analysis</h1>
<pre class="r"><code># loading in the required packages
suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(dplyr)

  library(ggplot2)
  library(lubridate)
  library(magrittr)
  library(tidyquant)

  library(ggjoy)
}))</code></pre>
<p>First, we will load in the data. All of the data used in this analysis is from <a, href = "www.football-data.co.uk">www.football-data.co.uk</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>files &lt;- list.files(path = &quot;epl_results&quot;, full.names = TRUE)

raw_data &lt;- map(files, read.csv)</code></pre>
<p>Below is the column information provided by the website: Div = League Division Date = Match Date (dd/mm/yy) HomeTeam = Home Team AwayTeam = Away Team FTHG and HG = Full Time Home Team Goals FTAG and AG = Full Time Away Team Goals FTR and Res = Full Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win) HTHG = Half Time Home Team Goals HTAG = Half Time Away Team Goals HTR = Half Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win)</p>
<p>Match Statistics (where available) Attendance = Crowd Attendance Referee = Match Referee HS = Home Team Shots AS = Away Team Shots HST = Home Team Shots on Target AST = Away Team Shots on Target HHW = Home Team Hit Woodwork AHW = Away Team Hit Woodwork HC = Home Team Corners AC = Away Team Corners HF = Home Team Fouls Committed AF = Away Team Fouls Committed HO = Home Team Offsides AO = Away Team Offsides HY = Home Team Yellow Cards AY = Away Team Yellow Cards HR = Home Team Red Cards AR = Away Team Red Cards</p>
<p>There are more columns provided in the raw data set that have to do with betting odds, however, we will remove them as they are not going to be used in this analysis. Additionally, only two seasons data has attendance recorded, so this will be removed. Looking through the data, all of the data sets for the 2000/2001 through the 2016/2017 seasons have all of tje match statistics listed above. The data sets prior to the 2000/2001 data set only have the general data and none of the match statistics. Becasue of these differences in available data we will only use the general statistics for the first part of this analysis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_general &lt;- map(raw_data, function(x){

    filter(Date != &quot;&quot;) %&gt;%  #the csv files pulled in some extra rows, this line removes them

    mutate(season = ifelse(month(Date) &gt; 7,

<p>To ensure that our tidying did not create any missing values, we can use the <code>summarise_all()</code> function.</p>

<p>Now that we know that the data is in a tidy format, we can begin exploring the data. As an Arsenal fan, I think we should start by looking at how Arsenal has done each year.</p>

<p>From these graphs, it looks like Arsenal follow a similar pattern every year, which is not surprising since the 2017 season was the first in Arsene Wenger’s tenure that they have not finised in the top 4. Looking at the plot for the 2017 season, it is clear that the period of the season that killed their chances of finishing in the top 4 was the strech of games between Februrary and March where their point increase flat lined. Let’s now take a look at team’s average finishing point total.</p>

<p>From this output, right away we can see that point ties result in the rank function returning a tie. The EPL determines ties first by highest number of goals for, and then by head to head match-ups. Looking at this first example of the tie between Arsenal and Aston Villa, we can see that Aston Villa had 3 more goals for, meaning they finished 4th and Arsenal finished 5th. For now, we won’t worry about fixing these ties.</p>

<p>As we can see from the tibble summary, there are several teams that have only been in the premier league for a single year, resulting in NaN values for the standard deviation columns. To avoid cluttering the next graph, we will remove any teams that have not been in the premier league for at least 10 of the 22 seasons being analyzed.</p>

<p>It looks like Manchester United have the highest average final points per season. They are followed closely by Arsenal and Chelsea, who are then closely followed by Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham. It is worth noting that Chelsea and Manchester City both have much higher error associated with their mean value, indicating they have much more fluctuation in the final point tallies. Another interesting take away from this figure is that the lowest average final point tally for teams that have been in the premier league for at least 10 of the previous 22 seasons is 39 points. 39 points typically gaurantees a season that is safe from relegation. However, for the teams with the lower average finaly point tally, such as Sunderland and West Brom, see the lower tails of their error bars treading dangerously close to relegation zone.</p>
<p>Now, it will be interesting to see how these teams final point tallies will look on the new joyplots from the <code>ggjoy</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>season_ending %&gt;%
  group_by(team) %&gt;%

         avg_final_points = round(mean(final_points), 0)) %&gt;% #add these columns for filtering and factoring respectively
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  filter(num_seasons &gt;= 10) %&gt;%
  arrange(avg_final_points) %&gt;%
  mutate(team = factor(team, unique(team))) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(final_points, team)) +
  geom_joy(scale = 0.9, rel_min_height = 0.01, fill = &quot;red&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 1) +
  theme_tq()+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Final Points&quot;,
       y = &quot;Team&quot;,
       title = &quot;Joyplot showing EPL teams&#39; individual season final point tally distribution&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-08-09-exploring-english-premier-league-historical-match-results_files/figure-html/final-points-joyplot-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>The joyplot confirms the conclusions drawn from the bar chart. Manchester United and Arsenal have the highest final point distribution and both have close to a bell curve. However, Chelsea and Manchester City both have much wider distributions as they have much more ups and downs over the past 22 years.</p>
